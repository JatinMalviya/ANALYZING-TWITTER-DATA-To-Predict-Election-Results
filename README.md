#ANALYZING TWITTER DATA
##To Predict Election Results

####Abstract
In recent years, twitter has become ubiquitous and important for social networking and content sharing. And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this project, we demonstrate how twitter content can be used to predict real-world outcomes and how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media. Though uninteresting individually, Twitter messages, or tweets, can provide an accurate reflection of public sentiment when taken in aggregation. In this project, we primarily examine the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques on providing a positive or negative sentiment on a tweet corpus. We accomplish this by mining tweets using Twitter's search API and subsequently processing them for analysis.

####Problem Statement
“Using the big data generated by Twitter we can get a public opinion about a particular topic, Politician's image in this case, by analyzing the sentiments expressed in the tweets- positive, negative or neutral.”
